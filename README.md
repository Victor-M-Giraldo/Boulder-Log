# Todo

- [ ] Begin converting the server to TypeScript.
- [ ] Allow users to edit the details of a climb.
- [ ] Create a page + an endpoint on the server to view climbs from ALL users (As long as they're public). Need to update schemas for this.
- [ ] Add pagination/filters to the GET endpoint (I can do filtering on the client side, but not sure if that's a good idea. Maybe ok for small datasets, but the DB is optimized to handle such things.)
- [ ] Add like a weekly status report kind of thing?
- [ ] Add support for different types of climbing (Sport, Trad)
- [ ] Implement with some API that has location data for rock climbing gyms, outdoor rock climbing spots, etc.
- [ ] Either return the notes associated with a climb by default, or add a query param option to do so.
